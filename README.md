# DriverActivityApp
A basic Android app with a lot of future scope of upgradation.
It makes use of a CNN converted into a tflite file and is used to classify side view images of driver's activities.
Plan for future updates will be:
1. Improve the neural network with increased accuracy and lighter file size along with using quantized tflite format.
2. Improving the app to make live classification possible instead of on click classification.
3. Making use of more data to make app compatible with different angles of the driver.

Below are screenshots of the app with 2 correct predictions and 1 wrong prediction.
